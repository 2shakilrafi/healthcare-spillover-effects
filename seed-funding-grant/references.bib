            Hospitals function within an environment in which regulation influences their daily operation, reporting, and reimbursement. This study tests whether regulatory reporting is affected by significant regulatory change. To examine whether this relationship exists, we utilize a comprehensive sample of more than 22,000 Medicare cost reports ({MCRs}) and corresponding {MCR} status changes spanning 2007–2014, surrounding the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“{ACA}”). We find that hospitals restate more Medicare cost reports in the post-{ACA} (2012–2014) period suggesting that regulatory reporting accuracy declines overall. The analysis is expanded to examine reporting accuracy across hospital types. There is an increase in {MCR} restatements by all hospitals following the {ACA}, but the timing varies. Further analysis reveals that the increase in restatements following the {ACA} is due to an increase in amended returns that outweighs a decline in {MCRs} that are reopened following their settlement.},

	abstract = {Quality knowledge spillovers can enhance the overall effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives. We study the presence and moderators of such spillovers in a multitask service setting, specifically in hospital inpatient care. Leveraging a national quality improvement regulation, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program ({HRRP}), which offers partial incentives for hospitals to reduce readmissions, we employ difference-in-differences econometric models on a nationwide database and find positive quality spillovers in the healthcare sector. Our findings indicate that the implementation of {HRRP} led to a significant decrease in 30-day readmissions among patients with clinical conditions or insurance types that were not targeted by the policy. Additionally, we find that task similarity played a positive role in promoting quality spillovers, while a hospital’s operational focus on target patients (i.e., the proportion of hospital volume targeted by the policy) did not moderate these spillovers. Notably, we observe that hospitals achieved these quality improvements without increasing the intensity of care provided, and that meaningful improvements in quality were associated with up to a 3\% reduction in hospitalization costs. This paper contributes novel insights into how regulators and policymakers can design narrow public policies and regulations that achieve broader results by exploiting the beneficial quality improvement spillovers of partial incentives.

	abstract = {Traffic flow prediction is an important part of the intelligent transportation system, and accurate traffic flow prediction can better perform the data management and control of the urban road network. Traditional methods often ignore the interaction between traffic flow factors and the spatiotemporal dependence of traffic networks. In this paper, a spatiotemporal multi-head graph attention network ({ST}-{MGAT}) is proposed for the traffic flow prediction task. In the input layer, multiple traffic flow variables are used as input to learn the nonlinearity and complexity existing in it. In terms of modeling, the structure of linear gating units is transformed using the full volume and applied to correlation learning in the temporal dimension. The spatial dimension features are then captured using a multi-head attention map network. Ablation experiments are designed to verify the use effect of each module. At the same time, several sets of parameter experiments are designed to obtain the best model parameters. The experimental results show that compared with the baselines, the {RMSE} of the {ST}-{MGAT} model is decreased by almost 2.340\%∼22.471\%, and the {MAE} is decreased by almost 7.417\%∼26.142\%. It is proved that the {ST}-{MGAT} model has high performance on the traffic flow prediction task.},

              Background
              There is increasing awareness among researchers and policymakers of the potential for healthcare interventions to have consequences beyond those initially intended. These unintended consequences or “spillover effects” result from the complex features of healthcare organisation and delivery and can either increase or decrease overall effectiveness. Their potential influence has important consequences for the design and evaluation of implementation strategies and for decision-making. However, consideration of spillovers remains partial and unsystematic. We develop a comprehensive framework for the identification and measurement of spillover effects resulting from changes to the way in which healthcare services are organised and delivered.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a scoping review to map the existing literature on spillover effects in health and healthcare interventions and used the findings of this review to develop a comprehensive framework to identify and measure spillover effects.
            
            
              Results
              The scoping review identified a wide range of different spillover effects, either experienced by agents not intentionally targeted by an intervention or representing unintended effects for targeted agents. Our scoping review revealed that spillover effects tend to be discussed in papers only when they are found to be statistically significant or might account for unexpected findings, rather than as a pre-specified feature of evaluation studies. This hinders the ability to assess all potential implications of a given policy or intervention. We propose a taxonomy of spillover effects, classified based on the outcome and the unit experiencing the effect: within-unit, between-unit, and diagonal spillover effects. We then present the {INTENTS} framework: Intended Non-intended {TargEted} Non-Targeted Spillovers. The {INTENTS} framework considers the units and outcomes which may be affected by an intervention and the mechanisms by which spillover effects are generated.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The {INTENTS} framework provides a structured guide for researchers and policymakers when considering the potential effects that implementation strategies may generate, and the steps to take when designing and evaluating such interventions. Application of the {INTENTS} framework will enable spillover effects to be addressed appropriately in future evaluations and decision-making, ensuring that the full range of costs and benefits of interventions are correctly identified.},

abstract = {Spatio-temporal models, which combine GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) and RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), have shown state-of-the-art accuracy in traffic speed prediction. However, we find that they consider the spatial and temporal dependencies between speeds separately in the two (i.e., space and time) dimensions, thereby unable to exploit the joint-dependencies of speeds in space and time. In this paper, with the evidence via preliminary analysis, we point out the importance of considering individual dependencies between two speeds from all possible points in space and time for accurate traffic speed prediction. Then, we propose an Individual Spatio-Temporal graph (IST-graph) that represents the Individual Spatio-Temporal dependencies (IST-dependencies) very effectively and a Spatio-Temporal Graph ATtention network (ST-GAT), a novel model to predict the future traffic speeds based on the IST-graph and the attention mechanism. The results from our extensive evaluation with five real-world datasets demonstrate (1) the effectiveness of the IST-graph in modeling traffic speed data, (2) the superiority of ST-GAT over 5 state-of-the-art models (i.e., 2-33\% gains) in prediction accuracy, and (3) the robustness of our ST-GAT even in abnormal traffic situations.},
